# etch

etch is a collaboration framework for the Craftwork Luna TV Browser, that lets you build applications for TV faster.

# How does it work?

etch provides an extendable DOM that allows you to use an HTML5 parser to create your application using custom elements
as if they were ordinary HTML elements.
 
You can also extend etch with addins that create any other capability you want, even customize the renderer itself.

Applications can be built offline with the etch compile command ( it is a preprocessor not a compiler as such ) to reduce
the loading overhead of and application.
